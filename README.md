# JavaScript Visible Fitting Y Axis Chart

![JavaScript Visible Fitting Y Axis Chart](visibleFitYAxis-darkGold.png)

This demo application belongs to the set of examples for LightningChart JS, data visualization library for JavaScript.

LightningChart JS is entirely GPU accelerated and performance optimized charting library for presenting massive amounts of data. It offers an easy way of creating sophisticated and interactive charts and adding them to your website or web application.

The demo can be used as an example or a seed project. Local execution requires the following steps:

-   Make sure that relevant version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) is installed
-   Open the project folder in a terminal:

          npm install              # fetches dependencies
          npm start                # builds an application and starts the development server

-   The application is available at _http://localhost:8080_ in your browser, webpack-dev-server provides hot reload functionality.


## Description

Example showcasing how active Y fitting to range of visible data points can be achieved in scrolling applications.

By default, the _fitting_ axis scroll strategy considers the full data set, not only the data points that are visible.

In some applications, this can be counter intuitive, which is why we created this example. This should provide a concrete reference on how this kind of "active fitting" can be implemented.

The idea is tracking the last couple of Y values and updating axis Y interval manually to only act according to the visible data points instead of entire data set.
